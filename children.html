        Cyber Safety Tips for Kids
        </h3>
        <p>
            Always use strong passwords that no one can guess. If you get a strange message, tell a parent or teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't click on links from strangers, and never share your address or school name online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Never turn on your webcam for strangers. Always ask an adult before joining video calls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ask permission before downloading apps or games. Some might not be safe for kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            If something makes you feel uncomfortable online, always talk to an adult you trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not believe everything you see online, some things may be fake or dangerous.
